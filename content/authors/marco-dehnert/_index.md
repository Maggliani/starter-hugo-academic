I am a Doctoral Candidate and Graduate Teaching Associate in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. I am a multi-method social scientist who studies Human-Machine Communication, Human-AI Communication, and the social impact of communication technologies. 

I use qualitative, quantitative, and rhetorical methods including interviews, textual analysis, thematic analysis, surveys, and experiments. My work integrates methods, concepts, and theories from a variety of disciplines and areas including communication studies, critical/cultural studies, human-computer and human-robot interaction, as well as sexuality studies. 

Currently, I am working on my PhD with a focus on how humans build relationships with machines such as social robots and AI technologies. In particular, my dissertation uses qualitative methods to explore human-machine relationality (how humans form relationships with machines like robots). 

My research has been published in a variety of academic journals such as Human Communication Research, Human-Machine Communication, Review of Communication, and in book chapters published by Routledge and SAGE (forthcoming). Our article [Dehnert & Mongeau (2022)](https://www.marcodehnert.com/publication/persuasion-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-theories-and-complications-of-ai-based-persuasion/) received the 2022 Outstanding Article Award from the Human Communication and Technology Division of the National Communication Association.

In April 2023, I co-wrote a piece in The Conversation on [Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream](https://theconversation.com/sex-love-and-companionship-with-ai-why-human-machine-relationships-could-go-mainstream-201856/). In June 2022, I was featured on the [National Communication Association's Podcast Series "Communication Matters"](https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3vugw-12574ca/) on the topic of alternative academic careers for communication graduate students. In October 2022, I was featured on the German science communication portal [Wissenschaftskommunikation.de in an interview](https://www.wissenschaftskommunikation.de/community-is-at-the-heart-of-transformation-62039/) about the topic of transformation. 

Don't hesitate to contact me. I am also happy to share PDFs of my publications with you in case you or your institution does not have access.
